# Hermes

## Background
Hermes is a blogging platform built from the ground up. It seemed like a great way to combine all of my web-development abilities, as well as brush up on a few that I hadn't utilized recently. Once completed, I'll be converting my personal website over to the platform.

## What does Hermes use?

Hermes primarily uses AngularJS for client-side code, and PHP for server-side code. Blog-specific information is stored within several tables in a MySQL database.

While it would be possible to throw together several large, do-it-all frameworks, that would only create spaghetti code and future confusion. Any and all third-party plugins were chosen for very specific reasons.

All plugins are managed through Grunt, which also keeps dependencies in line.
